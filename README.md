# README

This is a Rails app[1] that asynchronously serves a random joke from the [official_joke_api](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api).

This is accomplished by taking advantage of [ViewComponents](https://viewcomponent.org/), [TurboStreams](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/streams), and the new to Ruby 3.2 [Data](https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/3.2/Data.html) class. 

[1]`Todo`: Make this a rails engine/gem so senior engineers can pull this into their SaaS startup.
